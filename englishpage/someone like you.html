            I heard that you're settled down
            That you found a girl and you're married now
            I heard that your dreams came true
            Guess she gave you things, I didn't give to you<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
            Old friend, why are you so shy?
            Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
            I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
            But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
            I had hoped you'd see my face
            And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
            Never mind, I'll find someone like you
            I wish nothing but the best for you, too
            "Don't forget me, " I beg
            I remember you said
            "Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"
            "Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"
            You know how the time flies
            Only yesterday was the time of our lives
            We were born and raised in a summer haze
            Bound by the surprise of our glory days
            I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
            But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
            I had hoped you'd see my face
            And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
            Never mind, I'll find someone like you
            I wish nothing but the best for you, too
            "Don't forget me, " I begged
            I remember you said
            "Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"
            Nothing compares, no worries or cares
            Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
            Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?
            Never mind, I'll find someone like you
            I wish nothing but the best for you
            "Don't forget me, " I beg
            I remember you said
            "Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"
            Never mind, I'll find someone like you
